anything you imagine can happen
for a cat to become a lion it must lose its appetite for mice
never give up
sometimes its good to keep quite
when a lumberjack came to chop down trees in a forex they said oh wait the handle is one of us
the fall doesn't matter its the way you land
always push
chama
we fall so that we learn how to pick ourselves up
never say never
dont take things personally
when you compete with yourself you become better, when you compete with others you become bitter
good
